# simple-story-generator
A simple story generator to practice fine-tuning GPT. This was for an assignment in a Natural Language Processing class using [this dataset of fairy tales from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/annbengardt/fairy-tales-from-around-the-world) using the following packages:
- `from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer`
- `from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel`

This was originally run on Google Colab. The dataset used is too large to upload here, so please reference above. For running locally, please adjust dataset file access as necessary.
